Welcome to our container-ng organization! We are a dedicated group of developers focused on rewriting and enhancing container-related projects using Rust.
The primary goal of our organization is to advance container technology through Rust, focusing on improved performance and security while maintaining compatibility with existing ecosystems.



In addition to these, we are also working on innovative Rust-based projects such as:

- [netlink-ng](https://github.com/container-ng/netlink-ng): A developer-friendly netlink library, offering enhanced usability and functionality.
- [netns-ng](https://github.com/container-ng/netns-ng): A user-friendly net namespace operation library, simplifying network namespace management.
- [cni-ng](https://github.com/container-ng/cni-ng): A Rust-implemented version of CNI, aiming to bring Rust's advantages to container networking interfaces.
- [flannel-ng](https://github.com/container-ng/flannel-ng): A Rust-implemented version of Flannel, a container network overlay.


## Roadmap

We will finally rewrite all the container-related projects in Rust or other interesting language, such as:

- containerd / runc like container runtime
- kubernetes like container orchestration system
- all kinds of cni plugins like flannel, calico, etc. using ebpf and etc.

Currently, we write these projects for study and research purpose.

Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to achieving great things together in this field!
